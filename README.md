Raptor's project for Microsoft codefundo
## What we plan to build 
    We are planning to build a web service to establish communication between NGO's working to aid a particular affected area. 
    The issue we wish to counter with our product is that during natural disasters when many NGO's come to aid the affected area, they are unaware of each other's actions. This leads to situation in which NGO's are concentrated in a particular area and are not there in others due to which supplies for releif are not distributed evenly in all areas and also leads to double spending of resources (clothing,food,medication).                   
    We counter this issue by making a constantly updating dataset with approximate requirements for the affected areas. We get the initial data according to the population of affected areas and whenever an NGO provides releif supplies dataset will be updated. The updated dataset will help other NGOs to make an informed decision in which area they should work. This will help NGOs prevent double spending of limited resources.
## How does it work
    We will build a responsive website which will be accessible to all registered NGOs. They will be able to see requirement of areas and will be recommended areas which are in most need of help. When the NGO supplies with a particular resource, they will provide the details and the dataset will be updated accordingly.
## What datasets will be used
    An authorised agency will provide a dataset which will include population density of affected areas and the approximate amount of resources( food, clothing, medication) required.
## Technology that will be used
    We plan to build our website on React.js and html and css for layout.
    Azure functions will be used for manipulating dataset.
